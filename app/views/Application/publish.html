<h1>Sharing has never been easier</h1>
<p>
    You want to upload your project to Ceylon Herd? Weâ€™ve made it really easy for you, just follow these simple
    steps:
</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="span2">
        <h3>Register</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="@{Register.index}"><i class="icon-glass"></i> Register</a> to get an account.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span2">
        <h3>Claim your project</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="@{Projects.claimForm}"><i class="icon-plus"></i> Claim</a> your project, to be allowed to publish it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to review project claims, to ensure that the right person is allowed to publish the right
            module. This is an interactive discussion between you and us.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span2">
        <h3>Upload and validate</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="@{Uploads.index}"><i class="icon-upload"></i> Upload</a> your module, review and test it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We help you with validation by checking the contents of your module for many common mistakes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span2">
        <h3>Publish</h3>
        <p><i class="icon-share"></i> Publish your uploaded module.</p>
        <p>
            Once you've checked and tested your upload and all is good, you can publish it for the world
            to use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span2">
        <h3>Share!</h3>

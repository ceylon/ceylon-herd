    <p>
        This is the <em>project claims</em> page, where you claim new projects and we verify that you should be
        allowed to publish this module to Ceylon Herd.
    </p>
    <p>
        Verifications include license compliance (it must be open-source), non-duplication (it must not already
        be published by someone else), ownership (you must be allowed by the module author to publish on his behalf),
        and relevance (we will not allow harmful modules).
    </p>
    #{if projects.empty}
        <p>
            Your first step is to
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="@{Projects.claimForm()}"><i class="icon-plus icon-white"></i> claim new project</a>
        </p>
    #{/if}
    #{else}
        <p>
            I see you already have projects claimed, that’s great! You can review them here, and see which ones
            have already been validated (or refused if you’re out of luck), and 
            <span class="action-tip"><i class="icon-comment"></i> comment</span>
            on each claim if you feel you have something to add.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’d like to give up a claim, for whatever reason, feel free to 
            <span class="action-tip"><i class="icon-trash"></i> delete</span>
            it. If you’ve already published modules for this project, you will need to 
            <span class="action-tip"><i class="icon-share"></i> transfer</span>
            it first.
